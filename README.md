# Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System

## Overview

This project focuses on the development and implementation of an Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System designed to measure and analyze key air parameters such as CO2 levels, temperature, and humidity. The system utilizes the Infineon CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01 microcontroller to provide real-time data, helping users maintain a healthy and comfortable indoor environment.

## Objectives

- **System Design and Development:** Integrate CO2, temperature, and humidity sensors into a cohesive monitoring system.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Implement efficient data collection and develop algorithms to process and analyze air quality data in real-time.
- **User Interface:** Design and implement an intuitive LCD display interface to present clear and accurate air quality metrics.
- **Accuracy and Reliability:** Achieve precise measurements with a focus on temperature accuracy within ±1°C, humidity accuracy within ±0.1%, and CO2 concentration accuracy within ±50 ppm + 3%.
- **Application and Testing:** Deploy the system in various indoor environments such as homes, offices, and schools, and conduct extensive testing to validate performance and reliability.

## Scientific and Practical Significance

The scientific significance of this work lies in the comprehensive review of literature related to indoor air quality monitoring, the comparative analysis of controllers, and the selection of appropriate sensor elements and display components. Practically, the developed system can be implemented in various public and private indoor environments to ensure optimal air quality. The software libraries created can also support future developments with the CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01 microcontroller.

By achieving these goals, the Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System aims to significantly contribute to better health and comfort in indoor spaces.
